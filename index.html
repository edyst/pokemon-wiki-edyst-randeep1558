        <p>Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
            as
            part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first
            games
            released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also
            referred as the &quot;core series&quot; by their developers</p><br>

                </h4>
                <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three
                    starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
                    Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and
                    other sea-dwelling creatures.</p>

                <p>Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the three
                    starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
                    Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation
                    starter is often a plus.</p>

                <p>Grass is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Water, which constitute the three
                    starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
                    players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types
                    that are resistant to Grass moves.</p>

                <h4>Statistics of weight loss</h4>
                <p>The AR game&#39;s potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of
                    getting out
                    their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves.
                    A Reddit
                    Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he&#39;d lost 65 pounds between July and <br>December.

                    and been downloaded 800 million times. Although no longer the global phenomenon it was in 2016, the

                    incredibly popular.</p>

                <p>&quot;Greninja is the final evolution of Pokémon X and Y water-type starter Froakie. It has the
                    ability
                    to take
                    on an appearance resembling its trainer. Pokedex says: Greninja creates throwing stars out of
                    compressed
                    water.
                    When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two.&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;Lucario is a bipedal, wolf-like Pokémon with blue, cream, and black fur. It is considered
                        to be
                        prideful
                        and loyal to its trainer. Pokedex says: By catching the aura emanating from others, Lucario can
                        read
                        their

                    <p>&quot;Mimikyu caused quite a stir for its peculiar looks and sad backstory when it was originally

                        for
                        Pokémon Sun and Moon in 2016. Mimikyu is described as a Pokémon who felt so lonely that it
                        decided
                        to wear a
                        rag
                        in order to look like Pikachu, everyone’s favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual appearance
                        is
                        unknown.
                        A
                        scholar who saw what was under its rag was overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock.&quot;

                    <br><br>
                    <p>&quot;Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery temper. It is the final evolution
                        of
                        Charmander,
                        one of the starter Pokémon for the original game. Pokedex says: Charizard flies around the sky
                        in
                        search of
                        powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it
                        never
                        turns its
                        fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself. &quot;</p>

            <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We&#39;re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge
                        of Pikachu
                        is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent&#39;s
                        evolutionary chain.
                        Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast
                        amounts of
                        electricity. Maybe you&#39;ve bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a
                        question all
                        Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Answer is Raichu</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>What&#39;s the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There&#39;s the basic model you start your journey off
                            with, but
                            progressive upgrades are needed if you&#39;re looking to keep up with some of the stronger
                            wild Pokemon
                            who emerge in later routes. If you&#39;ve made your way through any Pokemon game, you&#39;ve
                            reached the
                            point where you&#39;re presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a
                            one shot
                            catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

    <p>Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media,<br> being the central gameplay aspect of the core series

    <p>Pokémon Go&#39;s Types are exactly the same<br> as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type
        matchups is<br> slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different

                Red and
                Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released
                sometime
                after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The
